## Description
Each signal sample is accompanied by an informative JSON file about multiple carachteristics, namely: signal type, number of channels, resolution, sampling rate, acquisition time and observations.

All this information is stored in the .h5 files generated by OpenSignals (except for the observations) and, thus, can be automatically retrieved in order to facilitate the work for the publisher. 

This module implements the required methodologies in order to generate the JSON file from an .h5 file produced by OpenSignals.

## Main Files
