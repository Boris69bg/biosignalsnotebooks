## Description

**<span style="color:#009EE3">biosignalsnotebooks</span>** is a set of documents and a **<span class="color1">Python</span>** library to provide programming examples in the form of **<span class="color5">Jupyter Notebooks</span>**, as companion to the **<span style="color:#009EE3">OpenSignals</span>** biosignals acquisition tools.

This collection of code samples has the purpose to help users of PLUX Wireless Biosignals systems, such as **bitalino** or **biosignalsplux**, and to the researcher or student interested on recording processing and classifying biosignals. The examples are set on a level of complexity to inspire the users and programmers on how easy some tasks are and that more complex ones can also be achieved, by reusing and recreating some of the examples presented here.

A **<span class="color1">Python</span>** library (entitled **<span style="color:#009EE3">biosignalsnotebooks</span>** ) is the base toolbox to support the notebooks and to provide some useful functionalities. It can be installed through pip command, like demonstrated in a [PyPI <img src="../../images/icons/link.png" width="10px" height="10px" style="display:inline">](https://pypi.org/project/biosignalsnotebooks/) dedicated page.

In many cases we also point and illustrate with code the usage of other python toolboxes dedicated to biosignal processing.

The notebooks will cover the full topics pipeline of working with biosignals, such as: **<span class="color1">Load</span>** a file; **<span class="color3">Visualise</span>** the data online and offline, **<span class="color4">Pre-Process</span>** a one channel signal or a multi-channel acquisition, **<span class="color5">Detect</span>** relevant events in the signals, **<span class="color6">Extract</span>** features from many different type of sensors and domains, **<span class="color7">Train and Classify</span>** among a set of classes with several machine learning approaches, **<span class="color8">Understand</span>** the obtained results with metrics and validations techniques.

These examples are carried in a multitude of biosignals , from ECG, EDA, EMG, Accelerometer, Respiration among many others.
The notebooks have a set of labels to help navigate among topics <a href="../MainFiles/by_tag.ipynb"><img src="../../images/icons/link.png" width="10px" height="10px" style="display:inline"></a>, types of signals <a href="../MainFiles/by_signal_type.ipynb"><img src="../../images/icons/link.png" width="10px" height="10px" style="display:inline"></a>, application area <a href="../MainFiles/biosignalsnotebooks.ipynb"><img src="../../images/icons/link.png" width="10px" height="10px" style="display:inline"></a> and complexity <a href="../MainFiles/by_diff.ipynb"><img src="../../images/icons/link.png" width="10px" height="10px" style="display:inline"></a> level to support the search for particular solutions.

We encourage you to share new example ideas, to pose questions info@plux.info, and to make improvements or suggestion to this set of notebooks.

**Be inspired on how to make the most of your biosignals!**


## What is **OpenSignals**

[**OpenSignals**](http://biosignalsplux.com/en/software/opensignals) is the companion application to *Plux* devices ([**bitalino**](http://bitalino.com/en/) or [**biosignalsplux**](http://biosignalsplux.com/en/)) where the users collect visualize an process biosignals in a intuitive user interface. Opensignals is free and can be used also with signals collected form other devices.

In some cases **OpenSignals** provides [*plugins*](http://biosignalsplux.com/en/software/add-ons) for advanced signals processing operations that automate some of the research process. Some of the plugins are curated and advanced versions of the base notebooks explained in here.

The list of plugins can be found here: http://biosignalsplux.com/en/software/add-ons

## What is **PLUX**

PLUX wireless biosignals is devoted to the creation innovative products for advanced biosignals monitoring platforms
that integrate wearable body sensors combined with wireless connectivity, algorithms and software applications.

We have been perusing the mission of making biosignals as accessible as possible to researchers and students in many areas of application, ranging from biomedical engineering, computer science, human computer interaction, sport sciences, psychology, clinical research among other fields.
